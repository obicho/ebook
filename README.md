This is an open source e-reader project designed to work on Raspberry Pi with a Pervasive Display 2.7 inch screen.

The vision is to build an e-reader OS which comes with a kernel and GUI that work nicely for a e-ink display.


<h3>Development environment setup</h3>
You can acquire the actual hardware and wire up them up according to the following instructions:
